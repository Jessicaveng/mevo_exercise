        You can end your trip in any Wellington City Council metered, coupon, or
        P120 and above parking space within the Home Zone. Parking in other
        legal spots, like P60 and clearways, is only permitted while on-trip
        (never end your trip in these spots) and you're responsible for ensuring
        that the vehicle complies with time limits. Please do not end your trip
        in any commercial parking lots such as supermarkets, private parking
        lots, residents parking, loading zones, taxi/bus zones, disabled,
        reserved locations or any other illegal spots. You'll also be
        responsible for any tickets or tows if parked illegally while on-trip,
        or when ending trips in any non-designated or approved parking space.

      <p>
        In Wellington, mevo operates a range of dedicated parking areas so that
